To build all the programs from Chapter 3 type:
   make all


To test the boolean multiplication programs (If everything is OK, make
exits silently) :
  make test


You can choose your compiler and compile options by setting the
variables CC and CFLAGS.  E.g, under sh type (before invoking make)
something similar to:
  export CC=gcc
  export CFLAGS="-O3"



The target "strassen_boolean" contains the elementary code for 32nX32n
matrices and an implementation of Strassen's algorithm for the same
tasks. When launched, the program runs and times many matrix
multiplications with varying matrix sizes and parameters. Each output
line is of the form:
matsize time_in_sec algo_identifier
